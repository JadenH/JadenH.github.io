My passion for computer science has led me down an exciting path of problem-solving in various industries. I have worked in the games and web industry, solving complex challenges such as educating through virtual reality at Octothorpe, managing massively distributed applications at Qualtrics, and building an accessible web application frontend at Neighbor. My talents in technology also gave me the experience of being featured in an article by Adobe titled “Jaden Holladay, developing limitless creativity”, and later a video showcasing my diverse skills.

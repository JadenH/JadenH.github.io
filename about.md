Hi, I'm Jaden Holladay, and I'm currently a student of the Entertainment Arts & Engineering (EAE) program at the University of Utah. Adobe featured me in a customer story entitled "Jaden Holladay, developing limitless creativity" where I demonstrated diverse talents. I have spent time developing web applications, and mobile/computer games. Several games I have created achieved top 10 in popularity on Blizzard Entertainment's Starcraft II Arcade. As a developer, I am passionate about building intuitive tools for artists and game designers. I have a well rounded background in programming, film, and graphic design.

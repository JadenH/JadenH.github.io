My passion for computer science has led me down an exciting path of problem-solving in various industries. I have worked in the games and web industry, solving complex challenges such as capturing video footage in a real-time virtual reality simulation to [collecting and analyzing big data on Blerp.com](../blerp). My talents in technology also gave me the experience of being featured in an article by Adobe titled ["Jaden Holladay, developing limitless creativity"](../adobe), and later a video showcasing my diverse skills. I specialize in tools and network programming and love to stay on the bleeding edge of technology.

### About
A simple platformer puzzle game created in my EAE 1410 class at the University of Utah. This was created using Pygame and Pymunk frameworks in Python. Das Block game combined the intriguing puzzle mechanics of Thomas was Alone with the rewinding time mechanic of Braid.
EAE 1410 is the introductory class to programming. For our final projects we broke into small groups to create a video game. The game was to be simple and completed within less than 2 months.
